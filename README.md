# react-collision-provider
Simple collision detection for 2D games in React.

## Getting started

The library gives you a higher-order component called `CollisionProvider`. Wrap a UI element inside it to register it for collision detection.

Check out [the overview](http://codyromano.com/simple-collision-detection-in-react/) on my blog, and see the `example` folder for more info on implementation.
